# How To Report Issues

Issues here are used to manage lots of things on the server, from bugs to player reports. 

When you create an issue, ensure you tag it properly. Failure to do so, will result in your request closed with no resolution.

If you are reporting a greif, include the location or locations you are missing items. Be specific and give exact X, Y and Z coordiantes. Point out specific chests with estimated quantities of items missing by marking them either in game with a sign, or by posting a screen shot with your issue.

If you are reporting a specific player, please give their name, the time at which they broke the rules (ensure you include your time zone so we can trace it back to the server's native time) as well as what rule or rules they have broken.

If you are reporting a bug in how something is performing, please give a step-by-step break down to recreate the issue including screenshots where appropriate.

If you are reporting a more substantial security issue, contact TA418#0418 on discord directly and DO NOT create an issue request here. We want security flaws fixed as quickly as possible without potential for any possible breaches.

Abusing the issue requests will have you banned from making requests.
